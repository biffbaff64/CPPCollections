# CPPCollections

A Playground library of CPP Collections classes, whether they're needed or not!

This is just a collection of C++ collections classes. I haven't taken into consideration the necessity of these classes,
they're purely written as an exercise in improving my C++ skills.

If you're reading through the code and spot anything I've done wrong, or that can be done better, please let me know.

Equally, if anything is any use to you, feel free to use it.

Note:

- This library targets C++ 17
- I have not bothered using a namespace with this library, so that classes can be used without having that namespace
  present.
